# Fraudulent_Credit_Card_Transaction_SnapML
SnapML library's Decision Tree classifier and SVM was used to train a model on a real dataset to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The Decision Tree model resulted in ROC-AUC score = 0.92 and the SVM yielded ROC-AUC score = 0.93 and hinge loss = 0.15. Multi-threaded CPU was implemented to reduce model training time.

The dataset includes information about transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
